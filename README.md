## Method Exploration for Titanic Prediction

In this project, I am exploring different methods for predicting survival on the Titanic. The goal is to find the best model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not. This is a project from Kaggle. 

This is an exploratory project for me to better understand certain ML models. 

### Data Preprocessing

Before fitting the models, I perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

### Model Selection

I try out various machine learning algorithms such as naive soft-margin SVMs, random forest, and perhaps a bit of deep learning. Model is evaluated with cross-validation. 

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid Search, Random Search to be implemented.
